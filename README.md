03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Homework 3 by Jordan Triplett
Completed 07/31/2020

This assignment has us create a password generator that randomly generates to meet certain user selected criteria, providing greater security to the sensitive data the employees have access to.

As specified in the assignment, one can click the "Generate Password" button to create a new, secure password. Once clicked, the user is presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. When each prompt is decided upon by the user, the password responsively changes its possible criteria. Once all prompts are succesfully answered, the password is generated and displayed in a box right in the middle of the page. Hope you make great use of your new password!
